CSC 471 - Project 2A

I know the files all say lab3.  I started this project with my lab 3
base code.  When I tried to change the names the files got corrupted,
so I am just going to leave them as they are.  I am sorry if it is
confusing!  :(

I submitted an earlier version of this program at about 12:05AM on
Wednesday morning/Tuesday night.  Please discount that version and
grade this one instead.  On the syllabus is says that we get 2 late
days for projects over the course of the quarter, so I will be using
one of those days for this project.
